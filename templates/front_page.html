  <h3>About this page</h3>
  <p>Welcome to Go-game where you can play the chinese board game Go against other players. The boardgame is written in JavaScript with jQuery and PeerJS to utilize webRTC to let players play peer to peer, only contacting the backend as the game begins and ends, never in between. You may need to use newer versions of Firefox or Chrome, for webRTC to be supported. This homepage does not support mobile at the moment.</p>
  
  <p>The backend is written in Python using Flask and SQLite3. The backend does the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> Serves the content on this site. </li>
  <li> Registers and keeps track of users in its database </li>
  <li> Tracks user stats such as wins and losses </li>
  <li> Matches players who want to play with each other</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>About Go</h3>
  <p>The game is a board game usually played on a 19x19 grid board. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.britgo.org/intro/intro2.html">rules</a> are fairly simple to explain. Each player take turns to place a <em>stone</em>, the goal is to build <em>territory</em>, which is done by completely surrounding empty tiles with stones of your color only. The opponent can disrupt this by blocking you with his stones or by capturing your stones. Capturing is done if a stone is completely surrounded by enemy stones. You can capture huge groups of stones in one move, or you can capture a single stone. The game ends when one player resigns (which is very common), or when both players pass (just as common). The game often comes to a point where placing more stones will not improve your position, and you pass, if the opponent passes too the scoring begins. The players count their territory, 1 point for each empty tile that belongs to their territory, and 1p for each captured stone. Then the players agree upon which stones are <em>dead</em>, this means that if both players began to play again, the stones would have been capttured without a doubt. These dead stones are also scored as captured stones. The game 99.999% of the time ends by a double pass or resign. </p>
  <h3>About this Go-engine</h3>
  <p>This JavaScript Go-engine can correctly count each player's territory by identifying groups of empty stones using a breadth first search approach and giving the group a color; black, white or neutral (no owner). A similar technique is used for identifying groups of captured stones while the game is in play. The problem comes when both players pass, this Go-engine is not strong enough to identify dead groups on its own and leaves it up to the players to mark them together, if they disagree the game is in play again until resign or double pass. Stronger Go-engines can detect dead stones or dead groups of stones almost perfectly using techniques like pattern matching and classifiers.</p>
